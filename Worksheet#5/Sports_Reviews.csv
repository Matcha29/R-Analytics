"Sports","Mini Basketball Hoop Indoor with Scorer and Batteries","H. SHOPS","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024","Purchased for my boys ranging in age 8 through 10 for their camp dorm.

Also came with a good amount of balls.",5,NA
"Sports","Original with App, Used by Celebrities - MMA Gear Boxing Ball","Jeff Fultz","Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2024","Very fun product.  I bought it  for a gift for others after buying one  and trying it out.I also bought a cheaper competitor version as well. The bollen is worth the additional money.  The size of the bollen  ball is bigger so the string does not get in the way. I can hit  the bollen  ball  174 times without a miss, but  with other brand,  only in  30's before the string gets in the way. Spend the extra and get this version to be safe.  The application is also worth having to track progress.",5,NA

"Sports","GoSports Slammo Game Set","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2017","Slammo is definitely worth your time and money! It is exactly how you would expect it to be: fun, original, and fast paced. I did not believe the hype was warranted but, believe me ladies and gentleman, it definitely is. Whether you buy a Spikeball set (its competitor) or a Slammo set, we can both agree that the basic concept for both games is intriguing, to say the least.  For those of you who may not know the specifics of the game, it is similar to volleyball, but instead of hitting over a net, you are hitting down on a miniature trampoline net. It is played 2 on 2, with both teams constantly moving and hovering around the net. That being said, you are safe in assuming that Slammo is enjoyed by people who enjoy staying active!  First and foremost, despite being named an off brand to Spikeball, the Slammo set arrived in great condition. The net and rim were fully intact, and it came with three slam balls of different sizes. This will give you the option of whether you want to play a fast paced game (small ball) or a slow paced game (big ball). As you may know, Slammo is, essentially, the same game as Spikeball; however, Slammo is 10 dollars cheaper which puts the product at only 40 dollars, making this product more affordable for everyone!  I would like to stress to you guys that this is a very safe game to play, creating a fun environment for all ages. In addition, you should not worry if you are new to this game. Slammo is still up and coming; therefore, you will likely find other people to play with that share the same skill set as yourself.  Slammo is most popularly played on a beach, but you can play the game anywhere where there is soft ground. With that said you can fold the Slammo set and put it in a bag, making it a prime traveling product for you! You can take this to your work and play on your breaks, or you could even just head to the local park if the beach is out of reach to you.  All in all, I personally think this product would be a great buy for anyone who enjoys living a dynamic lifestyle. On top of that, it is a very convenient game that can be adjusted for people of all ages and skill sets. If you are looking for a real bang for your buck, then Slammo is definitely worth the buy for you!",5,NA

"Sports","Under Armour Half Gallon Water Bottle Insulated","chase","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024","My household loves this water bottle so much that we have multiples in different colors. I love the neon color options. This is a heavy duty water bottle, surely holds a gallon of hydration, with a cool popping lock to secure the water lid. Can be handled with one hand, though it is pretty large and can be unwieldy.  The handle really only allows for right hand use. This jug has been dropped and rolled around in a vehicle, have never had issues with leaking. Keeps ice water cold for a long time. I like that it has hooks which I use to hang the bottle from the center console of my vehicle. I also attach my gym keys to the water bottle. Has been put through dishwasher several times. I use it so much, could probably stand to wash it more often, haha.",5,NA
"Sports","Sport - Indoor & Outdoor, No Boundaries- Similar to Pickleball","Lisa L.","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024","Due to the limited space we have, I moved a storage box and there we had just the right amount of space to play this game on our deck. It’s easy to put up and take down. I’ve always loved badminton but we never had the room, so this mini version is perfect. Would be easy to take on family vacays too. Came with a nice portable bag, 2 nice paddles, plenty of accessories. Good value! Easy to play! Would buy again!",5,NA

It’s the perfect blend of pickleball, badminton, and tennis, but with its own unique twist that makes it fresh and exciting.

The game is fast-paced and fun, but not so intense that it feels like work—it’s just the right balance of activity and enjoyment. Plus, the custom equipment and innovative rules add a playful yet competitive edge that keeps things interesting.I picture us setting up matches on weekends, creating lasting memories as we laugh, play, and bond.

"Sports","Hover Hockey Set for Kids","Amazon Customer","Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2024","The first time we used it, the puck worked for several minutes and was loads of fun.  Then it shut off by itself.  It seemed like the batteries were still good, as it started up again randomly a few minutes later, only to stop again.  However, once I fully charged the batteries, the random shut offs stopped.  My 5 year old loves it, and I enjoy playing with him.  The random ricochets make for an entertaining game, but it's not so fast that it's hard to react.  It's amazing that this set comes with both a motorized soccer ball and a hockey puck, nice for kids to get the experience of both sports.  The goals are a little flimsy and the instructions don't do a good job of indicating how to get the net to stay attached, but we just play without them.",5,NA
"Sports","Hover Hockey Set for Kids","Sarah Gress","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024","We bought this to replace a different brand and we love this one even more!

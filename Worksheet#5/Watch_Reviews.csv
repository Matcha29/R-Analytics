"Watches","Fossil Nate Men's Watch with Oversized Chronograph Watch Dial and Stainless Steel or Leather Band","Rohan P","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","The Fossil Nate Men's Watch is an impressive blend of rugged military-inspired aesthetics and reliable functionality. The oversized 50mm case makes a bold statement, and the matte black stainless steel paired with the black leather strap gives it a versatile, polished look that works well for both casual outings and dressier occasions.The chronograph features are easy to use, with subdials for tracking minutes, seconds, and 24-hour time, and the stopwatch adds a practical touch. The hardened mineral crystal lens holds up well against scratches, and the quartz movement keeps accurate time.The leather strap is comfortable and adjustable, though it might feel stiff initially—it softens up nicely after a few wears. I also appreciate that it’s interchangeable with other 24mm Fossil straps for added customization.Water resistance at 5 ATM is good for day-to-day activities, but it’s not meant for serious water sports, so keep that in mind.Overall, this watch delivers on both style and performance, and for its price, it’s a fantastic value. I’ve received multiple compliments on it already—definitely worth the purchase!",5,NA

I won’t buy another Fossil watch.Follow up 9/27/24.  Fossil did repair my watch at zero cost to me. My faith has been restored in Fossil watches. I do love this watch. It is big.

I used to buy the yellow gold but have now retired and my hair is whitish grey so my choice now is the silver trim and I will continue to buy the Timex easy read watches.",5,NA
"Watches","Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch","Jay Hughes","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2013","What a bargain","I've been looking for a casual watch for these past few months and this beauty is the one. I was lucky to come across this watch as I was just about to buy a $500 Citizen I had my eyes on from the last visit to the store. The saved money is real handy for a kid still in school. And I'm sure you've assumed already, I ended up buying the Timex Reader and I don't regret it.I already had an idea(a petty one) about what kind of watch I wanted. One with a leather strap, red second hand, simple ~40mm white face w/date, silver case. So it was awesome to find the Timex Reader. But after scrolling down the page and reading a few negative reviews about the absurd noise, pesky date setting and also the cheap price I was skeptical about the purchase. Whatever, I decided to just order it and see for myself.Here's my some information about the watch if you're considering buying it,The face:It's white, just like the picture. I only say this because other watches by Timex advertise online a white face but are actually a yellow-creamy hue.The Indiglo:It's the colour teal and it also doesn't entirely light up the face of the watch. There's about half a centimeter of unlit area at the top of the watch. Think of it like a nearly-filled fish tank. It's a feature I won't see myself using much, so I care little about the defect.The Band:It's not as brown as the picture would make you think. Some reviewers agree that it's a Maroon Red. When you actually zoom in on the image, you can see the red that I'm talking about. Just assume that it's reddish and not brown for expectations.The noise:I'm a student with a PC and a fan always running. So obviously this small watch won't over power the noise. With the watch up to my ear, of course I hear ticking but I personally find the repetitive sound soothing. Just a tip, apparently if you put the watch FACE down it some-what mutes the sound from what I read from some reviews.The time/date:What do you do when you get a watch? You set it's time. Right away, I was super frustrated with setting time and date with this watch like other reviewers. A little side story, I kept pulling and pulling the crown to get a certain time setting and the ENTIRE CROWN came out! It looked like a metal toothpick. I was confused about what the hell just happened and sorta like when you drop a vase and sweep it under the carpet, I immediately shoved the little guy back in the hole without much thought. I'm not very technical when it comes it watches which would explain why I'm sounding like a stooge.  Anyways, the watch still worked and I did end up figuring out how to set the time and it was a lot easier than I first thought. Throw away the instructions from the box and follow mine instructions below.How to set time:1. Set Day of Week (Thursday, Friday, etc.)Pull crown out and move it clockwise. If the time is being adjusted, you're doing it right. Keep turning it to get the right day of the week. For me I had to keep turning 3 full days, essentially 6 full 12 hour rotations.2. Set Date (1st, 4th, 29th, etc.)Pull crown out A LITTLE BIT. So little that there's barely a gap between it and the watch case. Then move the crown and you can set the date.3. Set Time (12:39, 1:04, etc.)Pull crown out normally just like when you set Day of Week and just set time as you would any other watch.By the way, when I say pull crown out, I don't mean entirely out of the watch like I did earlier. Once you pull out the crown and it seems it doesn't want to come out a centimeter more, then that's as far as it should go.Overall, great watch, great price, great buy.",5,NA
"Watches","Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch","merrckd","Reviewed in the United States on March 29, 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","I got it for my 75 yr old dad who thinks my obsession with watches is weird, but I love finding high value per dollar in ultra affordable watches too. My dad is frugal and likes that in his gifts, but low price doesn't have to mean junk. Also, he finds digitals tacky (so all the good low-end Casios were a no go).I found this Timex, ""scratch & dent"" on Amazon for just shy of $20, it arrived with  the box all beat up, the leather strap was not attached, and there were no spring bars. Still, the watch and strap were in brand new shape. I keep spare spring bars and it was easy to pop the strap on. Strap is on the short side, if you have larger than a 7.5"" wrist, you'll probably need a different one (a NATO would work well on it, imo). Also, watch is old school size, 35mm, so it may seem small by today's standards.Highly legible day or night, it's got indiglo back light, even though that can wear on the battery if used a lot, it does look sharp in the dark, especially for this price point. Water resistant enough you don't have to worry about getting it wet, but I wouldn't go swimming or shower with it.Watch hit everything my dad likes, Timex has quality choices for a budget watch, and it was still fun for me to find. Timex is not a brand I normally look at, but dad loves it and seeing it in hand, I feel good about the purchase.I rate 4 stars because it is a lot of watch for $20-30 bucks. Though buyer beware with scratch & dent, if I didn't already have spare spring bars, I would have been irritated.",4,NA

"Watches","Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch","Susan Rosanelli","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024","","This is my third one of these watches. I broke both of first two by dropping them on a tile floor. The first warch kept working but the back light did not. I use the back light a lot. The second one stopped working altogether. Now, if you change the battery yourself, that voids the warranty. If you take it to an authorized repair shop the cost is equal to the watch. The warranty is almost worthless.  But until i broke the watches they worked well and for a long time. So, i recommend this watch because it is inexpensive and works well. Just don't drop it.",5,NA

Big clear typeface, the numbers are legible even with a quick glance. So nice to have the bonus of a 24 hour clock too. The indigo feature helps in the dark of night and seems to forever.  I really like the date feature too. I confess it took me a while to set this part up but once it’s done it’s really handy. The black watch band strap is 18 mm and soft comfy leather.  If I needed more than one watch I would buy this same one again. This is my third timed indiglo watch and I think it’s my favourite.",4,NA

Also, watch is old school size, 35mm, so it may seem small by today's standards.Highly legible day or night, it's got indiglo back light, even though that can wear on the battery if used a lot, it does look sharp in the dark, especially for this price point. Water resistant enough you don't have to worry about getting it wet, but I wouldn't go swimming or shower with it.Watch hit everything my dad likes, Timex has quality choices for a budget watch, and it was still fun for me to find. Timex is not a brand I normally look at, but dad loves it and seeing it in hand, I feel good about the purchase.I rate 4 stars because it is a lot of watch for $20-30 bucks. Though buyer beware with scratch & dent, if I didn't already have spare spring bars, I would have been irritated.",4,NA

"Watches","Amazon Essentials Men's Easy to Read Strap Watch","Cee Jay","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","I recently purchased an AmazonBasics watch with a brown faux leather band, drawn in by the affordability and the simple, classic design it promised online. After wearing it for a few days, I've gathered enough impressions to share my thoughts, and unfortunately, they lean more towards the negative side, albeit with an understanding of the price point. Here's a breakdown of my experience:**Pros:**- **Affordable:** True to the AmazonBasics brand, the watch comes at a very wallet-friendly price, making it an accessible option for those on a tight budget.- **Looks Decent From Afar:** At first glance, the watch has a certain appeal, especially if you're not looking too closely. The brown faux leather band and the watch face present a decent attempt at a classic style.**Cons:**- **Uncomfortable Fit:** The fit of the watch is where my issues primarily lie. It's bulkier than I prefer, making it feel awkward and cumbersome on my wrist. This detracts significantly from the wearing experience, making it less likely that I'll reach for it daily.- **Feels Cheap:** Despite my realistic expectations considering the price, the watch feels cheaper than I hoped. The faux leather band feels stiff and low-quality, while the watch itself lacks the weight and solidity that often characterizes more well-made timepieces.- **Lackluster Durability:** Given the overall build and materials, I'm concerned about how well this watch will hold up over time. The band, especially, seems like it might wear down or break with regular use.**Conclusion:**While the AmazonBasics watch with a brown faux leather band certainly fits the bill for an inexpensive, no-frills timepiece, it unfortunately falls short in terms of comfort, quality, and overall satisfaction. The bulkiness and the cheap feel are significant drawbacks that can't be overlooked, even with tempered expectations at this price point. It might serve as an okay starter watch or a temporary stand-in, but for those looking for a daily wearer, it might be worth investing a little more in something that feels better to wear and promises greater longevity.",5,NA

I love the blue face, the date display, the accurate time, and the simplicity of the design. The stainless steel band is very attractive and comfortable. I was able to adjust the day & date easily. The wrist band was too big, so I removed a few links from it. I watched a Youtube video (because the how-to videos on the Citizen website did not seem to match my watch model). Removing links is not easy and you can easily lose the spring-loaded pin from the clasp. The unusual link pin clips are very tight, so it is difficult to slide them out. I used a steel nail to push out the pin (clip), then used small-nose pliers to pull them out all the way. I suggest paying a jeweller to adjust the links! I appreciated the fast delivery and reasonable price, however, the cardboard sleeve around the watch box was ripped on one corner.

"Watches","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","Chris D","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2016","","I haven't been wearing watches for several years but when I saw this I just had to have it.  In a world where there are clocks on our phones, our tablets, our laptops and computers I asked myself why do I need a watch? I pretty much summed it up as this. Wearing a watch is a classy, manly thing and I really did miss wearing a watch everyday.  So let's start again with a new watch. Besides, I now don't find myself digging in my pocket for my phone when someone asks me what time is it or when I need to look to see if my if I am running on time to a secret meeting with another covert operative for beers.This Timex has a classic design, with a rugged looking band that appears to be easily replaced down the road. I've only had it less than a week. But it feels like I have been wearing it for much longer than 5 days. I barely notice this on my wrist until I see it peeking out from my shirt sleeve or when I need to check the time. It has a solid feel to it but it doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome. I used to have a bad habit of catching watches on door frames while walking through doorways but I have yet to have this issue with this watch. Perhaps that might change when short sleeve weather comes around?The canvas style band is something new to me and I will have to get used to latching it. With one hole the band is too loose on my wrist and the next hole the band is almost too tight. I do not fault the watch for that small issue. After all, we are all built differently. Will the band stretch in time like my previous watches with leather bands or will it retain its current size? Perhaps in a few weeks or months I will know the answer to that question. As far as looks are concerned it has a classic military look and a rugged feel but by no means does it look like I'm trying to be tacticool. It is classic enough to be worn in the office, casually or in the park or at the beach. You could probably dress this up with a nice leather band for more formal office occasions or situations. But that is just a guess. It was instantly noticed by a few guys at work the first day I wore it into the office. Could it be that they are used to seeing me without a watch or just that it had a nice appeal to it? My wife likes the way it looks on me too. In other words, she didn't dismiss it as some trendy accessory and had nice things to say about the price.What about the Indiglo? Well in the dark it is easily readable. In somewhat dim light the hands seem to reflect enough light they they blend into the background and can be hard to see. But it is easier read without the indiglo in those situations. I really like the yellow seconds hand too. not too bright and just subtle enough to stick out of the black background. Does it keep accurate time? Since I set it after opening the box it appears to keep accurate time. It matches time with my Citizen, Fossil watches as well as my iPhone. If it loses any time I have yet to notice.What about the loud ticking? I don't hear it unless I put the watch up to my ear then it makes an audible tick. I have yet to hear it sitting on the nightstand next to my bed or even while wearing it. I have yet to get it wet, sweaty, dirty or banged up. But give me time, it will happen, I assure you. We will see if it stands up to regular daily use after I give it a thorough going over. I think with the classic styling of this watch it will look just as good with nicks and scratches as it does brand new. I am sure to add pictures and a follow up review down the road. I really like this watch and hope it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.",5,NA
"Watches","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","K.S.","Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2024","Quality for the price!","The Expedition Scout is an affordable quartz field watch. I found the strap comfortable and enjoy the simple design of the dial. The activatable backlight illuminates the whole dial surface (so you don't have to rely on lume plots) and is very readable in the dark. I was solidly satisfied with this purchase at first.However, 1 major downside to this watch is that the movement inside is LOUD. In a quiet room, you can absolutely hear the watch ticking on your wrist. You can even hear the watch ticking across a reasonably sized room if it's quiet, such as on your bedroom dresser at night. I found how audible the ticks are to be annoying enough where it detracts from the wearing experience.As my return window has passed, I will keep the watch as a ""beater"" watch for doing things like yard work or hiking. To be fair, the audible ticks are not noticeable during most daily activities, like going for a walk, going to the supermarket, etc. You need to be in a quiet room/location for the ticks to be noticeable. However, when I'm sitting down to read a book, or have a quiet conversation at home with a friend, I do not want my watch to be so audible that it's distracting or annoying.If it wasn't for the audible ticking of the watch, I'd give the watch 5 stars, especially considering its affordable price.

But that is just a guess. It was instantly noticed by a few guys at work the first day I wore it into the office. Could it be that they are used to seeing me without a watch or just that it had a nice appeal to it? My wife likes the way it looks on me too. In other words, she didn't dismiss it as some trendy accessory and had nice things to say about the price.What about the Indiglo? Well in the dark it is easily readable. In somewhat dim light the hands seem to reflect enough light they they blend into the background and can be hard to see. But it is easier read without the indiglo in those situations. I really like the yellow seconds hand too. not too bright and just subtle enough to stick out of the black background. Does it keep accurate time? Since I set it after opening the box it appears to keep accurate time. It matches time with my Citizen, Fossil watches as well as my iPhone. If it loses any time I have yet to notice.What about the loud ticking? I don't hear it unless I put the watch up to my ear then it makes an audible tick. I have yet to hear it sitting on the nightstand next to my bed or even while wearing it. I have yet to get it wet, sweaty, dirty or banged up. But give me time, it will happen, I assure you. We will see if it stands up to regular daily use after I give it a thorough going over. I think with the classic styling of this watch it will look just as good with nicks and scratches as it does brand new. I am sure to add pictures and a follow up review down the road. I really like this watch and hope it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.",4,NA
"Watches","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","Quality control","Reviewed in Canada on November 20, 2024","Good","The Expedition Scout is an affordable quartz field watch. I found the strap comfortable and enjoy the simple design of the dial. The activatable backlight illuminates the whole dial surface (so you don't have to rely on lume plots) and is very readable in the dark. I was solidly satisfied with this purchase at first.However, 1 major downside to this watch is that the movement inside is LOUD. In a quiet room, you can absolutely hear the watch ticking on your wrist. You can even hear the watch ticking across a reasonably sized room if it's quiet, such as on your bedroom dresser at night. I found how audible the ticks are to be annoying enough where it detracts from the wearing experience.As my return window has passed, I will keep the watch as a ""beater"" watch for doing things like yard work or hiking. To be fair, the audible ticks are not noticeable during most daily activities, like going for a walk, going to the supermarket, etc. You need to be in a quiet room/location for the ticks to be noticeable. However, when I'm sitting down to read a book, or have a quiet conversation at home with a friend, I do not want my watch to be so audible that it's distracting or annoying.If it wasn't for the audible ticking of the watch, I'd give the watch 5 stars, especially considering its affordable price. However, I have to subtract at least 1 star because of the audible tick.",5,NA

"Watches","GOLDEN HOUR Fashion Business Mens Watches","Mor Nicole-Main","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2024","","I got this for my husband, and he is thrilled with it! He says it's comfortable and feels expensive even though it was very reasonable, cost-wise. He also says the tool to customize the links in the band was easy to use. I'm pretty sure he'll never take it off.",5,NA

It is well built, has a good size band and watchface. Definitely a mens watch when it comes to the size and weight. The clasp locks solid. The black color is a true black. I'm very happy with this watch purchase and I will definitely check out this brand again when I decide to get another watch. Since I like variety that could be in the very near future.",5,NA

The date this is fixed by moving the hands forward until the right date is achieved then set your time.My last $30 watch lasted a year and a half. It wasn't this watch.  Hopefully this one will last longer.",4,NA

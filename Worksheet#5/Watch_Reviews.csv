"Watches","Casio Illuminator AE1500WH Series","D.W. D.","Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2024","I have 3 colors of this watch. It’s very comfortable, and the display is awesome. Big numbers. Looks like a G-Shock. If you want a watch to tell time, provide an alarm and use as a timer/stopwatch that’s easy to see, buy it. The light works fine. I have the grey with the negative display, and it’s easy to read too. Also have the tan. I wish the black and tan were available in negative display but they still look good the way they come. Great watch..great price..great battery life. Pick a color and buy it.",5,NA
"Watches","Casio Illuminator AE1500WH Series","Dru Ha","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023","I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!",5,NA
"Watches","Fossil Nate Men's Watch with Oversized Chronograph Watch","Rohan P","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024","The Fossil Nate Men's Watch is an impressive blend of rugged military-inspired aesthetics and reliable functionality. The oversized 50mm case makes a bold statement, and the matte black stainless steel paired with the black leather strap gives it a versatile, polished look that works well for both casual outings and dressier occasions.The chronograph features are easy to use, with subdials for tracking minutes, seconds, and 24-hour time, and the stopwatch adds a practical touch. The hardened mineral crystal lens holds up well against scratches, and the quartz movement keeps accurate time.The leather strap is comfortable and adjustable, though it might feel stiff initially—it softens up nicely after a few wears. I also appreciate that it’s interchangeable with other 24mm Fossil straps for added customization.Water resistance at 5 ATM is good for day-to-day activities, but it’s not meant for serious water sports, so keep that in mind.Overall, this watch delivers on both style and performance, and for its price, it’s a fantastic value. I’ve received multiple compliments on it already—definitely worth the purchase!",5,NA

"Watches","Amazon Essentials Men's Easy to Read Strap Watch","BK","Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2024","Easy to read, big, nice looking, and reasonably accurate. You do not feel it is a luxury watch, nor do your friends. When you adjust the time with the button, it goes around too fast, and you feel something is cheap inside. However, if the only purpose of your watch is to show the time, It is a good choice.",5,NA

"Watches","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","Lars Johansson","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024","This is a good-looking watch. The looks are true to the WWII aesthetic that inspire many watch designs today from affordable to top-tier.  Modern manufacturing provides quality and value that's on par with much more expensive watches. The robust and quality leather band surprised me. It's all wearing well and the push-button Indiglow feature lights up the entire watch face. And water resistant to 50m to boot! I'm a pretty demanding/picky shopper and I just keep looking at this and thinking wow. Highly recommended.  The 40mm case seemed a little large at first but I've gotten used to it and it provides numbers large enough to easily read with a glance.",5,NA
"Watches","Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch","Chris D","Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2016","I haven't been wearing watches for several years but when I saw this I just had to have it.  In a world where there are clocks on our phones, our tablets, our laptops and computers I asked myself why do I need a watch? I pretty much summed it up as this. Wearing a watch is a classy, manly thing and I really did miss wearing a watch everyday.  So let's start again with a new watch. Besides, I now don't find myself digging in my pocket for my phone when someone asks me what time is it or when I need to look to see if my if I am running on time to a secret meeting with another covert operative for beers.This Timex has a classic design, with a rugged looking band that appears to be easily replaced down the road. I've only had it less than a week. But it feels like I have been wearing it for much longer than 5 days. I barely notice this on my wrist until I see it peeking out from my shirt sleeve or when I need to check the time. It has a solid feel to it but it doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome. I used to have a bad habit of catching watches on door frames while walking through doorways but I have yet to have this issue with this watch. Perhaps that might change when short sleeve weather comes around?The canvas style band is something new to me and I will have to get used to latching it. With one hole the band is too loose on my wrist and the next hole the band is almost too tight. I do not fault the watch for that small issue. After all, we are all built differently. Will the band stretch in time like my previous watches with leather bands or will it retain its current size? Perhaps in a few weeks or months I will know the answer to that question. As far as looks are concerned it has a classic military look and a rugged feel but by no means does it look like I'm trying to be tacticool. It is classic enough to be worn in the office, casually or in the park or at the beach. You could probably dress this up with a nice leather band for more formal office occasions or situations. But that is just a guess. It was instantly noticed by a few guys at work the first day I wore it into the office. Could it be that they are used to seeing me without a watch or just that it had a nice appeal to it? My wife likes the way it looks on me too. In other words, she didn't dismiss it as some trendy accessory and had nice things to say about the price.What about the Indiglo? Well in the dark it is easily readable. In somewhat dim light the hands seem to reflect enough light they they blend into the background and can be hard to see. But it is easier read without the indiglo in those situations. I really like the yellow seconds hand too. not too bright and just subtle enough to stick out of the black background. Does it keep accurate time? Since I set it after opening the box it appears to keep accurate time. It matches time with my Citizen, Fossil watches as well as my iPhone. If it loses any time I have yet to notice.What about the loud ticking? I don't hear it unless I put the watch up to my ear then it makes an audible tick. I have yet to hear it sitting on the nightstand next to my bed or even while wearing it. I have yet to get it wet, sweaty, dirty or banged up. But give me time, it will happen, I assure you. We will see if it stands up to regular daily use after I give it a thorough going over. I think with the classic styling of this watch it will look just as good with nicks and scratches as it does brand new. I am sure to add pictures and a follow up review down the road. I really like this watch and hope it takes a licking and keeps on ticking.",5,NA

"Watches","Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 44mm Bluetooth Smartwatch","Debbie","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","This watch has been a good match for me. It looks nice, has the functions that I want, and works without problems.  The battery doesn't last as long as i would have expected. Perhaps I have too many apps going. It does charge very quickly.",5,NA
"Watches","Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 44mm Bluetooth Smartwatch","Princhessa","Reviewed in the United States on August 16, 2023","Very easy setup if you already have a Samsung account, phone, etc... I literally didn't have to do much at all - registering it online with the SN visible on the back side of the watch was so easy - and seemed to automatically connect with phone. I swear, I blinked and was set up!It's been as far back as the when I replaced my first Galaxy watch (was it a 2?) with the Fitbit Charge, and from then forward I was enjoying the FB's app and displays, and cheaper pricing. I stuck with that.This Galaxy comes out at a time shortly after Google purchasing FB, and the changes are just not as appealing. I wanted something more universal, so I've returned to GalaxyWatch!It is heavier than I'd thought it would be, but even that and the extra thickness after wearing it for a few hours, I'm not even noticing it. I currently have the FB on the right wrist, and Galaxy on left.Figuring out how to use some of the features like O2 and ECG was a little tricky, but it gives you a step by step both on the phone and/or on the watch itself and walks you through it. On the O2, if you're not holding it like it says - it doesn't actually prompt to start. That had me flustered for a bit until finally the button was there to start.Setting targets for weight/muscle/fat% was a bit confusing, but a simple Google search led to some clarity, and even that's set up now with my first 2 week goal. Use the watch to scan for body composition, and then step on a scale and record that to get your starting numbers... then there's a button to add a target. It would be nice to be able to set up several targets at once, but will have to revisit and set those small goals or just set a larger goal and watch progress as you go.  I set only the weight as target and it adjusted the rest to match up. If you try to enter all 3 manually, you're likely to get an error because it doesn't quite match up between the 3 figures. Pick one and done!So, yes... only a few hours in, but these are the highlights I noticed in my excitement to share... so many clock faces available, so many customizable settings for each of the faces as well... FB was only just really getting to this point. Be wary, they're not all free... but there are more than enough free ones, and the ones I saw for a price, were 0.49 and 0.99 - definitely manageable if it's a must have!I'll have to revisit this review as I get more acquainted and find more pluses and minuses!PS - size... since I was going with the Classic, I hoped as I ordered the 43mm would be big enough for my aging eyes - and yes, it is perfectly fine! I'm actually thankful I did not go with the 47mm, because this one is just perfect. I do not have petite arms, but I do have smaller wrists, and it looks just fine.  I would say, if you're very petite, and/or dainty... the regular 6 in the smaller of the 2 options is probably better. But I wouldn't go with the 47mm unless you really have a larger arm or it really may seem too big/bulky.Definitely glad I bit during the pre-order!",5,NA
"Watches","Fossil Grant Men's Watch ","Michael F.","Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2024","This watch gives you a great impression! Very nice looking, easy to read, and comfortable. Love the dial, like the white background, and even the brown Band is nice and soft and comfortable. Looks like the crystal is very well made too! Scratch resistant. I have another fossil in a different model and it's been excellent for over 10 years now. They are accurate, and look more high-line and expensive than they are.

"Watches","Fossil Grant Men's Watch ","Michael F.","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024","I trust the Fossil Watch Brand. I’m very picky about what brands I buy. This watch exceeds my expectations in appearance and function. I highly recommend it to up your fashion and style game. It’s a very attractive accessory and reasonably priced.

"Watches","Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch","The Blind Reader","Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2024","I bought this watch as I have low vision and need something easy to read. I have always had good luck with the Timex brand. It is indeed easy to read and at the push of the stem, glows in the dark, always great when having to wake up in the night for kids or prayers.Now, what everyone complains about: YES, you WILL have to turn the stem of this watch many, many times to set the date and time correctly. I say, put your favorite audiobook, recording, etc. on your headphones and just go for it. It's not difficult, just time consuming. This is the only drawback of this watch.It is very handsome to wear, and comes a good six inches up my arm as a woman. I keep meaning to take it to a jeweler to have it resized, but rather like it as is, as I always seem to have my sleeves rolled up all the time anyway! It is water resistant, I do take it off in the shower but I have gotten it wet washing my hands and it hasn't hurt the watch at all. Five stars!",5,NA
"Watches","Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch","SuperMomHikerGirl","Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2017","I'm a woman and have very small wrists. I wanted a larger watch that I could easily read without squinting or putting on glasses as I don't like wearing glasses that much as I don't need them for my computer. But, I didn't want a huge watch. So, this watch was large without being huge. I knew that the band would not fit snugly, but this band was said by other reviewers to be a big small on them. I like bands to be loose so that they can sit down on my hand when I have long sleeves on or be pushed up a few inches on my arm when I'm doing something messy like cooking dinner. I also wanted an inexpensive but dependable and classic looking watch. Because it became fashionable for women to wear watches that looked like they'd borrowed them from the guy in their life, I felt this would be fine without seeming too odd.Also, I like to check the time when I wake up because I wake up so early and don't want to get up so early that I'll be exhausted later. So, the light was important to me. I've had a few Timex watches before, and I found the Indiglo feature very helpful.I was a little concerned about the stretch band pulling my arm hairs as I'd noticed on a watch a long time ago that that happened. This one very so slightly does that but mainly because it's loose and I move it around. If it were fit so it stayed put on my arm, I don't think it would do that throughout the day. It's not actually a problem as it's so slight. I don't really notice it much.As I said, I've had a few Timex watches in my life, and they tend to keep on ticking. My last one, honestly, didn't last more than 18 months, but that was an exception. Fortunately, I got that one very, very cheaply on a sale with points and so on at another retailer. I hope this one lasts for a few years as it has for others.While I like the dull metal stretch band, I am also considering getting silicone bands in different colors. They are pretty inexpensive, and you can get the quick release type that pop in and out easily to be worn with different outfits. I'm thinking of black, buff/pink (kind of like a white person's slightly tanned skin), and red. Maybe white too. For now, I'm just using the silver band. As another reviewer mentioned, the provided band is duller than the watch. However, it actually looks good that way. It's a more casual look than it would be with a shiny band. I also think it would look good with a shiny band, however.So, having read that some people had difficulty setting the day of the week, I handed this to my young adult son as he was just sitting around playing on his computer while to did all kinds of housework. He set everything but the day and didn't bother with the day of the week. Not intending to be his slave without any rewards, I looked up directions on the internet, sent them to him, and handed it back with just enough words to every so slightly shame him into doing it. I wasn't mean, but this kid got accepted to MIT. So, he did it. I also asked here for directions and got directions from the manufacturer and several other reviewers. So, look through the questions and the answers are there. Basically, you pull the knob out and turn it through as many 24-hour days as you need to to get to the day of the week you need. I think you go clockwise. The direction matters, so check that first. It's absolutely NOT a big deal once you know how to do it. I think the reason so many people have gotten confused is that these days were are used to clicking on things and having them set right away. It's the same reason many older people have trouble with digital things. They are used to mechanical things. Anyway, it's not a big deal and it's definitely not a reason not to buy the watch.As I said, I bought this watch because it had a big face and hands and would be easy to glance at without glasses AND because it had Indiglo lighting when you push the knob AND because it had both the day and the date. I do check my online calendar daily and schedule appointments every single day for my business and personal matters. However, I admit sometimes I forget what day it is and what the date is. One reason I didn't buy the women's version of this watch is that I wanted the DAY and the date, not just the date. The women's version must be too small to have both. What I've noticed is that in dim light, I have a harder time reading small print. Also, the day and date are much smaller than the numerals for the hours. That's normal, of course. But, I do have to work a little harder to read the day and date. Further, the day and date are not illuminated by the Indiglo light. I guess because this is a mechanical watch, they are turning on different disks and don't have that feature. However, when I check my watch in the dark, I only want to know what time it is and don't need to know the day of the week and date. So, it's not actually a problem. The only thing I would say about that is that because I can read it but it's harder to read and I rarely go without my phone, the day/date feature is probably not as important to me as I made it when I made the choice of the watch. I probably could have gotten the women's version and been happy with it.As for this man's watch on me, I had the idea that women's watches are frumpy looking and liked the idea of a bigger watch face, but I probably would like the utilitarian look of this watch in the women's size. I just got this so will think about this overnight. When I pinch about 5 of the links out, the watch actually looks pretty good and not like I borrowed a man's watch. So, removing some links is also an option. As I said, my wrist is tiny, and so many women would not need to remove any links to make this watch fit and some might have to add links. If I removed 8 links, it would be snug on me, but I wouldn't be able to dangle it down on my hand if I had long sleeves with snug cuffs or push it up on my arm if I were doing something messy. So, I do have options: loose if I do nothing, snug if I remove 8 links, and semi-fitted if I remove only 5 links.And, I can use quick release silicone bands to change the look to go with different outfits. I figured out that if I got the black band, that would work for business as it almost without looking closely would come off as a black leather band. It would also have a soft, comfortable feel (based on reviews and if you get the ones that are like that so read the reviews before buying). Although I don't mind the metal expansion band and didn't notice it when I wore this for an hour on an errand, I probably would love the soft silicone bands. I'm middle aged and healthy, but if you were older or had very delicate skin for other reasons, a soft silicone band would be a great option for you. You can get soft leather bands that would feel nice, but silicone is easier to clean, can be gotten wet without staining or swelling, and is sturdy. As it is, my skin is healthy, but I have sensitive skin, not thick or rough. I can't wear pierced earrings with nickle in them. I don't think that will be an issue for this watch as it never has been for a Timex before. but I did notice that one reviewer had removed the band but left the little bars in and looped a one-piece leather band through the bars so that there was almost no skin contact with the metal. If you want to look DIY or artsy, you can even make padded fabric watchbands that have snaps to hold the watch face or use thick grosgrain ribbon to make bands to your color preference. I would even sew velvet ribbon to grosgrain ribbon or sew lace to grosgrain ribbon to make a cute band for certain casual fun outfits or a slightly dressed up event where casual touches would look cute. Because this is so inexpensive and supplies for making watch bands would be cheap due to the size needed, you could give one of these to a teen and help them come up with lots of different bands for it. You can buy band hardware (buckles, etc.) easily online.The other thing to consider if you're very small boned is that larger watch will be heavier. My son, who is 6 feet tall and energetic, walking miles fast rather than driving, and fairly strong, also has small wrists and pointed out to me that a larger watch might feel heavy. He'd been given one years ago and took it off regularly as a result. He took it off in the orchestra room while playing his cello, and someone stole it. Having said that, this is smaller than many large-faced men's watches. It's not one of those huge watches. It covers about 2/3 of my wrist width, not all of it like many men's watches would. Although I noticed the weight when I put it on because my son advised me to consider that, it didn't bother me. With a silicone, fabric, or leather band, it would be even lighter. Heavier than most women's watches, but not as heavy as those chunky men's watches.When considering how practical it is to have a men's watch, I also considered size related to the small cuffed long sleeve shirts and long sleeved sweaters one might wear to work. How much of a hassle would it be to dig under my sleeve to get to the watch in a meeting? Truth is that I could wear this watch over a long sleeved thin sweater and get away with it because my clothes are so classic and practical. Also, because I live in Los Angeles where it's hot a lot and I am a woman who prefers short sleeves and jackets or cardigans to long sleeves as my main layer to avoid hot flashes, this is really not an issue for me. I also have the option of giving this watch to my son if I decide I want a smaller one and never wear it. However, I don't think he's taken the watch I gave him five years ago off since I gave it to him. So, that's all theoretical.In conclusion, I would say that this watch is a realistic purchase for a woman, even if she has small wrists. If she has very delicate skin as elderly people often do or wants it to be lighter, you can find some very nice, very inexpensive silicone watchbands that are easily cleaned and easily interchangeable with quick release pins. If she needs something breathable due to the heat, you could go with a thin leather band, a ribbon band (a thick ribbon or two layers of ribbon due to the weight and width) or a fabric band that you make or get on a crafter sales site. Or, she could wear it over a washable wrist band or a long sleeve. I personally think this is a great watch for teenage girls and boys if they would enjoy an analog watch because they can have fun with different bands.Edited to add: I slept with this watch on, but to be comfortable doing so, I put the watch over my sleeve on my long sleeved pajama top. I'm a person who doesn't like rough feeling surfaces on my skin, and so this made it comfortable to sleep in, and I didn't notice it during the night. The weight didn't bother me either. I have a feeling that silicone bands are in my near future unless I figure out a clever way to line the band with something soft. This is not a criticism of the band as it's a normal expansion band. But, I like smooth, soft surfaces next to my skin.Also, for those who have not had the Indiglo watch face light before, the more you use it, the faster your battery dies. It's not a big deal as the battery will last long enough, but just remember that and don't give it to a kid to play with for hours unless you want to replace the battery soon.And, I already have enjoyed the day/date feature as I woke up wondering if it was Thursday or Friday and glance at it first thing after I turned the light on at 4:30 a.m.Some might wonder why you'd buy a watch with an expansion band if you really want something softer next to your skin. For me, this 35mm watch face was a better size than the 40 mm  Weekender Unisex watch Timex sells AND it has both the day and date whereas the Weekender Unisex has neither the day nor date. You can spend upwards of $40 for the Weekender Unisex with a grosgrain ribbon band or you can buy this and then go get whatever band you want. The silicone bands I like are very well reviewed and go for less than $12 apiece, so it's about the same price to get a quick release band plus the watch at a slightly smaller size that is better for me than to buy the Weekender Unisex model that is a little too big, doesn't have the day/date, and also might not have the color I want. I like the grosgrain bands a lot as they are comfortable and you can get them in lots of colors. But, you do have to wash them regularly. To wash them, I mix a little laundry detergent in very hot water in a small container, like a cup--just about half a cup of water is fine--enough to cover. Then, let it sit for several hours in that and then rub so that all the loosened soil and oil from your skin comes off, rinse in running water while rubbing and soak again in hot water to rinse. If you have to do that regularly, it helps to have another band or another watch unless you don't mind not wearing the watch for several hours. They might be more comfortable than silicone because they breathe, but the silicone can be washed and dried within minutes. For this watch to use a slip through band like the grosgain bands you can buy or make, you need the posts and I assume but don't know that you can just use the posts provided with this band. You can also buy them to make this watch accept slip through bands.",5,NA

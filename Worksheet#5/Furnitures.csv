"Furnitures","Yoobure Tree Bookshelf - 6 Shelf Retro Floor Standing Bookcase","Rida Khan","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2024","Not the largest capacity bookshelves but nice enough if you keep buying books ahah AND extremely compact and can be styled as a decorative item of furniture in the room. I got the pink color on an impulse was a little afraid but turned out rather OK! Assembling was fairly easy as it’s the same steps for the shelves after you figure out the first one. I had no issues with screws or alignments, just that I wish they had more pink stickers to cover the nail heads that show on the sides! Can probably request them if feel so inclined. Overall a good buy and good value for money & wouldn’t hesitate to get another",5,NA

"Furnitures","SUPERJARE Nightstand with Charging Station","Lindsey2717","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2024","My son’s room is on the smaller side. We needed an end table that wouldn’t take up a ton of room but that also gave him a little more storage and a place to charge his phone. I knew this would be small based on the dimensions, but it really is SMALL. So, just be aware of the height and width dimensions when thinking about purchasing. It worked perfectly for the space we needed it for, but I can see why some people are complaining about the size. Again, I stress, this is small and you need to measure before purchasing. My son loves the charging ports on the top of the table, because it makes it so much easier to charge his phone and headphones each night. I also really like the fabric storage drawer bin. It gave us more options for places to keep odds and ends that had no real “home” in his room.Additionally, this was fairly simple for my husband to put together. He read the instructions (shocker for a man, I know- ha), and he had it put together in around 15-20 minutes. It’s sturdy and the wooden top doesn’t look too cheap.So, if you’re needing a really small, affordable option for an end table, this is a great purchase!",5,NA

"Furnitures","WLIVE Dresser for Bedroom with 8 Drawers","Ayla","Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2024","This took hubby limited time to together, it was straightforward and simple. I like the fabric drawers, they are sturdy and easy to take in and out of the dresser to make organizing clothes easier. The compact size is perfect as it still hold a lot of clothes. It’s perfect for us, as we don’t have mountains of clothes. The price is right and definitely worth it compared to expensive all wood dressers of similar size and quality. I definitely recommend!",5,NA
"Furnitures","MAXYOYO Folding Sofa Bed, Convertible Sleeper Chair with Pillow Foldable Mattress with Back Support","Larry","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2024","I got this for my niece who stays over all the time. She’s 8 going on 9 and wanted to redesign my spare bedroom that she calls hers. She wanted a Japanese style mattress so it could be rolled up and moved when she needed more floor space. I came across this and she agreed it was cute and would give it a try. It’s absolutely perfect! I love that I can turn it into a chair when she’s not here and still have tons of room for a large air mattress when we have guests. It’s quite comfortable and easy to move around. We may get a couple more for camping and for using in the back of my Jeep when you go to the drive in movies and fireworks.",5,NA

"Furnitures","WLIVE Night Stand, Small 2 Drawer Dresser","Lolo H.","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024","Exactly as pictured. Using as a night stand. Deep drawers hold a lot so only using 1 drawer. I placed the  2nd drawer on bottom to make a shelf for my basket. I guess you can do that to the top drawer instead if you prefer.. The wooden top is beautiful and is very sturdy for holding bedside items. It is a nice height and doesn't take up space like night stands usually do. We also got the matching dresser to replace a heavy wooden dresser and are very pleased. This furniture is easy to assembly, light weight, offer decent storage and takeup less space. Im glad I chose the wood look, it makes the pieces feel more like furniture instead of storage.",5,NA
"Furnitures","SONGMICS 30 Inches Folding Storage Ottoman Bench, Storage Chest","Ellen","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2024","Pros-This has lots of space inside and was extremely easy to assemble!. 1-2-3, All done! It is very sturdy  when assembled, and has diamond tuck on ottoman top. I thought it was really cute. Sits at the foot of the bed perfectly.  I also put one behind the sectional for blanket storage.  We ordered Beige, but there are many colors to choose from.Cons-Its a little high in price I thought, but I am glad I bought it. The only thing I would change is sending one or two more dividers, so you can separate more things if needed.All in all it is worth getting.",5,NA

"Cellphone Accessories","INIU Wireless Charger","Daniel Moore","Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2024","Keeping this on my nightstand has made life a bit easier. I may buy another for the desk. I just set my phone on the charger and I get a good charge while I sleep, and it quits charging when the phone is full, so no worries about over charging.Works great with the phone in both landscape or portrait mode. That's confirmed. I use it in both orientations regularly. I've not been able to place it in a way where it does not charge and the phone is able to stay on the stand at the same time.I am using a case for my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, and there is no issue charging through the case.I love that I can grab my phone off the nightstand in the morning and not have to worry about accidentally pulling it too hard and tugging on the cable against the charging port! Wireless charging is awesome, and this charger delivers it well.The light sensor on the back will automatically dim the charging light when in a dim or dark room, and makes it dim enough to not bother me.",5,NA

"Cellphone Accessories","LISEN Retractable Car Charger 4 in 1","Nicole Mckinney","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024","I got this when the power went out and I needed to charge stuff in my car. The old one I had would barely charge 1% in 10 mins. It came the day before the power came back on and I really didn't need it anymore. But after I tried it, I decided I definitely needed it and wanted to keep it!!! This is absolutely a good value, it charges super fast, it's sturdy and durable( I'm a clutts) it has both compatible cords for iPhone and android. You do have to sort of push the cord back in a little bit that's all. It fits way back in where my port is for the charger. And it also has a USB slot too. So you can charge 3 different things simultaneously. I will have to upload a picture later. But I am so glad I have this. I need it for when I have to use directions for a long time. And I don't have to worry about if I forgot a cord. Totally functional for a person who doesn't like clutter too! I have a feeling it is going to last a long time.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","LISEN Retractable Car Charger 4 in 1","Randi","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2024","I needed a new car charger because the one I purchased from Apple stopped working it didn’t last as long as I had expected, it was retractable that’s why I bought it I like Organization not cord’s all over the place when I’m not using them and iit does change your phone fast. I like it so much I’m going too buy another one for my backseat Area so it’s convenient for anyone who’s a passenger to change their phone instead of asking to use the one up front… this is when a charger seems after a. wile become lose and the cord starts looking frayed or even scaring my Hardware in my car from people letting it retract wildly…. The value for the money the size is compact  it has folding capability  functionality and compatible with other devices . I highly suggest this car charger",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","VANMASS 【65+LBS Strongest Suction & Military-Grade 2024 Ultimate Car Phone Mount","Miranda","Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2024","Easy to install. Decided to put in vent, but came with dashboard mount as well. Able to hold my iPhone XS with a large Otterbox case and holds it firmly in place. Tilts in the right direction and is quite sturdy. I especially like the push button for widening the arms and the soft rubbery surface that holds the phone in place. Excellent product.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","VANMASS 【65+LBS Strongest Suction & Military-Grade 2024 Ultimate Car Phone Mount","Tina","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2020","*****Update-Feb 8th, 2023****Before editing this review again, I was thinking, ""How can I find a single element that adequately expresses all aspects of a phone mount?""Approximately 3 years ago, after having the pleasure of contacting VANMASS customer service about the suction cup temperature issue, I determined that their customer service goes above and beyond any other offered by an internet-based company.Usually, when purchasing an item the transaction is over after I can use it as expected and the seller has resolved all my issues. But what I didn't expect was that when I returned to the office back from my Xmas break in 2023 I received an email from a VANMASS wishing me a happy new year and wanting to know how the product was performing now.The 36-month warranty offered by VANMASS is more than a simple guarantee. No matter how much time has passed they still consider the needs and feelings of each customer. These guys have again renewed my belief in humanity with their over-the-top customer service.To the initial query, I believe I have an answer, and that factor is the CERTIFICATION OF TIME. Although the Amazon marketplace is sophisticated, the mission of the phone mount is simple - to make driving easy. This mount has done that for the past 3 years, and I think it will do so well beyond that given its high quality of it.I travel quite frequently with my kids and love to go on adventures with them. Each year we prepare a list of places and people we wish to visit that year. Now that the world has opened up again and the once-sleepy cities have long since been awakened it's time to get out into the world again.We traveled through numerous cities with this car mount, ensuring that we can reach where we need to be. When it's cool outside I'll use the suction cup and when it's hot I'll move the mount to the vents. Either way, you can use the holder to hold your phone as it charges while also allowing it to navigate. This not only ensures safe driving but also consistently saves us money on expensive gasolineUltimate success in life is created by day-to-day persistence, a process that is often tedious, repetitive, and requires patience. The same experience that this product has undergone allows it to continue to exist today. It is unique but only because it has gone through a long period of improvement.I discovered that they had added more colors. Among them is purple, my daughter's favorite color, I didn't hesitate to get one then because I had no idea that any company even made a purple phone holder. When it arrived, my daughter couldn't wait to open the box because she was excited to have a mount that would match her purple outfit lol. The mount looked as adorable as she did.If you are looking for a phone mount that can be installed on the dashboard, windshield, or air vent to free your hands and bring convenience to your driving, you can trust VANMASS. They are very professional with their service and their products are reliable.******Original review******I was conquered by VANMASS! If you told one customer service of  a car mount company that every time you finish eating Mexican food, your car mount will be fall off, so you want a refund, what should the customers service do? VANMASS gave us the right answer, they communicate with me over 10 emails, finially solved the issue.I have to say that the moment I got VANMASS I was very satisfied. The package is very simple and elegent. You can tell it is not the same thing as the $5 car mount on the market. The product is an artwork, the cutting is neat, all parts are complete, and the installation is very easy. At first, there was no issue at all, then something strange happened.There are two Mexican restaurants not far from my company, I picked up my lunch there sometimes. The strange thing is that every time I come back from Serrano's,  my car mount will  fall off, and then  I need to clean the suction cup and re-attach them to the dashboard. But I didn't encounter this problem when I came out of another Mexican restaurant. I put the car in the same parking lot,  it is so frustrating.I contacted VANMASS for warranty, I think VANMASS is a little wronged though. This kind of thing keeps happening, it is really frustrating. I did not not  expect that, the customer service of VANMASS, reply me immediately, and did not think it was a spoof.After she got the details, she asked a question about how long I usually stay in Serrano's. Then I understood the problem. Serrano's business is better than the other restaurant in near street. It took me about one hour to finish my lunch at Serrano's instead half-hour at others.Customer service told me that when the temperature outside the car is 100 ℉， after half  an hour, the temperature inside the car is about 130℉, after one hour, 150℉. The car mount fall out because of the temperature growth rapidly.From then on,  I would insert  the car mount into the the vent or park the car in the shade during the hot weathers, no matter which Mexican restaurant I went to,  I never encountered this problem again, lolI am very grateful to the customer service of VANMASS for helping me solve the problem. I truly feel that VANMASS is  professional and responsible, the reply is timely and not perfunctory. In short, VANMASS is a brand I CAN TRUST! Best shopping experience on Amazon.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","Miracase Phone Holders for Your Car with Metal Hook Clip","Cecelia Aguirre","Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2024","I purchased this for my husband to use in his work truck to hold his phone while driving. It is amazing. Very sturdy, easily installs, and holds his Galaxy S22 Ultra perfectly.  He liked it so much that I ordered one for myself.  I have the Galaxy S20. There is an opening on the bottom of the holder for the charging cord and a button in the back for easy release.  Attaches to your ac vent and tightens easily.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","Miracase Phone Holders for Your Car with Metal Hook Clip","Stephen P. Percoco","Reviewed in the United States on November 3, 2024","I bought this to replace one that was too small for my phone. It is much sturdier than the old one. I really like the spring loaded arms that open up with a touch of a button in the back of the unit and ratchet down to hold the phone tight.  It swings easily from a vertical to horizontal position.  The holder also grabs the vent solidly.  Nice product at a reasonable price.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","PopSockets Phone Grip Compatible with MagSafe","Jack...the engineer","Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2024","Its a simple design that just works for its intended purpose.  It’s also not expensive at all.  No regrets here and definitely worth buying.It’s a strong enough magnet to not worry about it popping off but not too strong where it’s impossible to remove.It makes holding and using even the biggest iPhone/Samsung galaxy models with one hand a piece of cake.It’s sturdy and allows you to prop up your phone for easy viewing on a table.It works well with every pop socket accessory holder.There are plenty of colors available and they are all aesthetically pleasing (many people I know bought some of the different colors).I have dropped my phone and it surprisingly hasn’t gotten any scratches so it is oddly durable (a surprise bonus).",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","PopSockets Phone Grip Compatible with MagSafe","Justin McIntosh","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024","The purchase was simple and shipping was fast. The product was in perfect condition. Magnet strength is awesome and is net easy to remove which is a great thing in my opinion. Durability will be determined oven time. Works as advertised and looks great too. The build quality seems very nice as well. Would recommend to friends and family.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand","Ryan Kizer","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2024","I first saw a Pop Socket and ignorantly thought ""how stupid"" and ""that's a chick fad."" Then I saw a knock off brand on clearance for $1 and was like why not try it. I liked it, but it sucked as well lol. So I caved and bought the actual Pop Socket branded one and couldn't imagine a smart phone without one now. My wife has the Pop Socket wallet and loves it too. It's good for holding big phones one handed, can be used as a kick stand for watching videos on a desk or table. The only ""complaints"" I have is the adhesive won't stick to a ""nude"" phone that has a glass back and it doesn't work with wireless charging. But I don't trust my $1k phone with no case anymore and I don't own a wireless charger except the one built in my car, but I have a fast charging cable in my car so I don't care. If you care about either of those ""complaints"" then a Pop Socket isn't for you, but if you own charging cables and use cases, this is 100% the way to go.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand","Scott Woodruff","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024","I recently purchased the PopSockets Phone Grip with Expanding Kickstand in Black, and I am thrilled with how much this little gadget has improved my overall phone experience! After using it for a couple of weeks, I can confidently say this is one of the most practical and versatile phone accessories I’ve owned.Comfortable and Secure GripFirst and foremost, the grip it provides is fantastic. If you’re someone who frequently uses your phone with one hand, this PopSocket is a game-changer. I used to feel like I was always on the verge of dropping my phone, but now I can comfortably hold it with one hand, even when texting or scrolling through social media. The expandable grip is ergonomic, and it makes handling my phone so much easier, especially for extended use.Convenient Kickstand for Hands-Free UseThe built-in expanding kickstand is another feature I love. Whether I’m watching videos, making video calls, or following a recipe while cooking, the kickstand holds the phone securely in both portrait and landscape modes. It saves me from constantly propping my phone against random objects, and it’s surprisingly sturdy for something so compact. It easily pops out and clicks back into place, making it super convenient.Sleek and Minimalist DesignThe all-black design is sleek and stylish. It blends seamlessly with my phone case and doesn’t feel bulky or intrusive. The PopSocket doesn’t add much extra weight or thickness, and it fits easily into my pocket or bag without any issues. It’s the perfect balance between form and function.Repositionable and DurableOne thing that stood out to me is how easy it is to reposition the PopSocket if needed. I’ve moved mine a couple of times to find the perfect spot, and it adheres just as well each time without leaving any residue. The adhesive is strong, and the grip itself feels very durable. I’ve used it daily, and it still works like new. I expect it to last a long time.Great for Taking PhotosAs someone who loves taking photos, I also appreciate how much more stable my phone feels when I’m snapping a picture. It makes getting the perfect angle a lot easier, and I no longer have to worry about my phone slipping out of my hand while I’m trying to capture a shot.Final ThoughtsOverall, I couldn’t be happier with my PopSocket purchase. It enhances the usability of my phone in so many ways—whether I’m gripping it more comfortably, using the kickstand for hands-free activities, or simply appreciating the minimalist design. If you’re on the fence about getting one, I highly recommend it. It’s a small investment that adds huge value to your everyday phone use.Highly recommend!",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","iOttie Easy One Touch 6 Universal Car Mount Dashboard","Slap Happy","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2024","Its easy to see why this a best seller. The dashboard pad makes the suction cup work perfectly. The trigger button when you put your phone in works, the release is great. The flexibility of where you can put it is far superior to any other holders i have tried. I decided to go with this over a charging or magnetic holder, and glad i did. The cable charges my phone much better and doesn't get the phone hot. I hang the cable over the holder arm so its right there and takes 2 seconds to plug in. Also good price for what you get.",5,NA
"Cellphone Accessories","iOttie Easy One Touch 6 Universal Car Mount Dashboard","Jonathan Seely","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2023","I've gone through about 10 different phone mounts over the years trying to find ""the one,"" and this might be as close as I'm getting.First, one of the key features of this model is that it comes with a mounting plate. This makes mounting much easier and gives you more options as you can stick it nearly anywhere and have a smooth, flat surface to mount the holder.  The dashboard of my truck doesn't have many places that are flat enough to mount a phone holder, and this created a lot more options. The place I chose to mount is too textured for a suction cup to grip, but the mounting plate sticks no problem.The suction on the mount is incredible. Even with it turned ""off"", the grip is still rock solid. I actually drove around for a day with it ""off"" and the mount never let go. To remove from the mounting plate though is easy, simply pull up on the tab and ""peel"" the suction cup off. It will take a little effort, but that's good!The all joints on the arm are ""indexed"" with interlocking teeth, which means once it's tighted down it won't move, at all. It also won't (cannot) loosen up over time from vibration/wear. Adjustability is great, too, though this particularly model won't extend fore/aft if if that is a concern.Now, the phone grip is just as good as the rest of the mount. Lightly press your phone into the mount and the arms snap close, tightly gripping your phone. My phone is relatively heavy (Google Pixel 7 in a Google branded hard case), and it does not move, AT ALL. My truck isn't the smoothest riding vehicle and Michigan roads aren't great either, but this is the first mount I've used that shows zero movement or vibration. It's rock-solid. I've tried several highly reviewed magnet mounts, and none come even close to this stability.Removing the phone is easy. I can do it one-handed, simply squeeze the ""wings"" together and the jaws pop open and lock.The only minor issue I have with the mount is that the phone tends to sit every so slightly crooked, which only is an issue as the bottom charge port is sometimes off-center and partially blocked by one of the lower ""jaws"" of the mount. I can usually just nudge the phone a bit to adjust, or at worst take the phone out and try again paying more attention to how it's oriented before closing the jaws.All in all, seems to be an excellent product with good design and better than average construction and details.",5,NA

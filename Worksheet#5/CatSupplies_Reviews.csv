"Cat Supplies","Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter - Premium Unscented Cat Litter w/ Natural Ingredients","mich","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2024","Ok, guys. I have 6 cats. 6 OF THEM. Not fosters. They are all mine and I love them. So listen up to this crazy cat lady. I'm talking practicality here.This has been my go to litter for 6+ months so I'm  pretty familiar with it.The price is right. Very cost conscious, even at half a dozen furrballs. I get the 40 lb. bags and go through 5-7 bags a month and I have massive litter boxes to accommodate a 20 lb. cat. I haven't quite worked out auto ship for my actual usage yet. Obviously, normal people will need far less.For anyone worried about the 20 lb.cat, he is not overweight. He is just a large cat. Veterinarian confirmed, said he had a healthy weight for his size.  I just happened to pick out gorgeous Norwegian Forest cat mix at an adoption event. Try googling the breed if you like big, beautiful cats  :)I love that this is unscented. Had heard scents can bother cats but I recall one time when I changed a litter box and then went to sit near it and was overwhelmed by the litter scent. This cannot be pleasant for kitty. I always go for unscented now. The odor control is still great when used correctly.For new cat owners, in particular, a quick note. If your cat likes to take big stinky kitty poos and does not like to cover them, there is no litter in the world that can save you. Pro tip: If you are so inclined, go bury it yourself real quick to lessen the damage.If you scoop more often a few thing happen. 1) you are going to get better day to day odor control from any litter doing this. 2) the litter will last longer. That smell that gets into the actual litter box is, from my experience, when the litter becomes too saturated and cannot clump and just ends up half soaking up urine and falling apart. This litter mudpie cannot be scooped. Then you have to clean out the entire litter to get rid of the smell. This litter clumps extremely well if you keep up with it. These things mean you use less litter, save more money, and have a fresher smelling house.Now, I was going to rate it a 4 star for tracking. And then I checked the description and it say LOW tracking. Ah! They got me! And, I have to say the very slight tracking I get with this is nothing compared to other litters. I get an occasional pawprint on my couch. Totally acceptable.There is a little poof of dust when you quickly drop litter from a 40lb bag. Its clay, I don't know how much you can do about that. But it does not get litter particles EVERYWHERE like other litters. I tried one litter where my hardwood floors literally had a whitish cast after a few days. I do not worry about my cats lungs with this litter. Not perfect, but I'm giving credit where credit is due.I have tried some of the new kinds of fancy litters that have come out in the last few years and my cats have literally opted to go to the bathroom directly next to the box in protest until I went back to my normal litter. Beware. (Had no issue with this litter when I switched.)Pro tip: They aren't joking about the # of cats +1 litter box rule. If you have 2 cats, you need 3 boxes. Yes, I have the suggested 7 litter boxes. Doing this allows them more access, can help cats with litter box noncompliance, and it keeps the contents more spread out which means less over saturation and ruin of the entire box. Even if you scoop a wee bit less than you normally would.A lot of issues I hear about seem to be caused by people not understanding how to use litter and how it works. This lack of knowledge leads to doing things that sabotage your efforts.So, this litter is cost effective and, like it claims, low tracking, infinitely lower on dust than normal litters, clumps extremely well, comes in kitty nose friendly unscented, last a respectable amount of time if you scoop properly, and you don't have to worry about a cat boycott of the litter box. So I went with the 5 stars. It does its job and it does it well.Just make sure you are doing your part for kitty waste management and this litter is a dream.",5,NA
"Cat Supplies","Dr. Elsey's Cat Litter - Premium Unscented Cat Litter w/ Natural Ingredients","Gizmo","Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2022","I wanted to give a very detailed review because I tried using reviews to choose litter, but it was very hard to do because often the reviews vary wildly in describing the same qualities of the same litter. I’ll start by saying I’ve tried Fresh Step, Tidy Cats, Arm & Hammer, Pretty Litter, and various other silicone litters before settling on this one. I have one short haired, older female kitty who has one litter box.For a long time, I used Arm & Hammer clump and seal litter. I didn’t hate it, but felt like it didn’t clump as well as it could and I wanted to try something else. So I switched to Pretty Litter for a while because I liked the color changing aspect. However, I started to notice that it wasn’t lasting as long as it was supposed to and I didn’t want to keep paying that much for something that wasn’t doing what it was supposed to. I liked the no-clump aspect, but it seemed to irritate my kitty’s toes. She was constantly picking stuff off the hair on her feet (and she doesn’t have long hair at all) and I felt like it tracked a lot. I then tried a few different silicone litters, but the more affordable ones were too hard to find regularly (ie often out of stock).So after all that experimentation, I had a few qualities I was looking for:- low dust- low tracking (I live in a very small apartment where there aren’t many steps between the litter box and the couch or the bed)- low odor- hopefully non-clumpingI ended up compromising on the non-clumping part, because this litter meets my other wish list items so well.- Dust: I haven’t tried some of the “natural” litters like the ones made from corn, wheat, etc. so I can’t speak for those. But otherwise I have used many of the popular litters and I have concluded that there probably isn’t a 100% dust free litter. I think it’s just the nature of such a product. However, this has less dust than any other litter I can think of and I love that.- Tracking: again, not sure if there exists a 100% no track litter. But in my experience, this tracks the least. I did notice after I was sick for a couple weeks (still scooping ofc but not as worried about cleaning up the litter on the floor) it did start to get a little spread out and ground into the carpet. But as long as I was vacuuming regularly I barely noticed any tracking.- Odor: this and the low tracking were probably the main selling points for me. I’ve honestly forgotten to scoop the box a couple times because I. NEVER. SMELL IT! Even when scooping it, it hardly smells. Only towards the end of its life cycle does it tend to stink much, but again, that’s only when scooping. And I use the scent free one! I hate the smell of scented cat litter (it gets too strong for me and in my head it’s a “cover up” smell, like spraying perfume on a dirty shirt or pants lol) I think this is the best quality of this litter. If odor is your sticking point, I’d definitely recommend trying this.- Clumping: as I said above, this was what I compromised on. **This IS a clumping litter.** But it clumps EXTREMELY well. Honestly sometimes it’s a bit like scooping a rock. If it’s a larger clump sometimes I have to put in some effort to break it in half. So because of that and how great the other qualities are, I was fine with switching back to a clumping litter. I have a Litter Genie so it’s not too much of an inconvenience. Actually, my only (very minor) complaint would be that the clumps get too heavy to fill the Litter Genie bag as full as I’d like, but it doesn’t bother me that much.- Price: I haven’t sat down and figured out how this one compares to the others in terms of price, but it’s at least comparable and I think very reasonable for the quality of what you get. The 18lb bag is a little more than enough to fill up the litter box, and has been lasting about a month.So glad I decided to try Dr. Elsey’s! I hope this review is helpful to anyone else shopping around for litter like I was.",5,NA

"Cat Supplies","Laser Cat Toys for Indoor Cats","Alena Peterson","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2024","recently bought the YVE LIFE Laser Cat Toy for my indoor cats, and it has been a fantastic addition to their playtime. The toy features a real random trajectory, which keeps my cats engaged and entertained for hours. The motion-activated sensor is a great feature, as it only turns on when my cats are nearby, saving battery life and ensuring they get plenty of exercise.The three speed modes (fast, slow, and mixed) are perfect for catering to my cats' different energy levels. The rechargeable battery is a huge plus, as I don't have to worry about constantly replacing batteries. It charges quickly and lasts for a couple of days with regular use.One of the best things about this laser toy is its adjustable angle. I can easily change the direction of the laser to keep my cats on their toes, and the quiet motor ensures it doesn't disturb the household. The build quality is excellent, and it feels durable enough to withstand my cats' enthusiastic play.Overall, the YVE LIFE Laser Cat Toy has exceeded my expectations.

However it seemed to lose its effectiveness. He lives inside 70 % of the time, but he started having a flea issue,  So I tried this instead and he is very happy. He has not had any issues with fleas since I started this 5 months ago. It is easy to apply. Plus he is 14 pounds.

"Cat Supplies","PetSafe ScoopFree Crystal Pro Self Cleaning Litter Box","Nick","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2022","Edit: 11/26/2024, product is still working with no issues.Recently PurchasedPet info:IndoorKitten: 13 weeks oldRescued: 2 weeks ago (at 11 weeks)Other pets: 2 dogs (1 pit bull and 1 puggle)Diet:Dry Diet/Free to eat whenever: Nature's Variety® Instinct® Original Kitten Food - Natural, Grain Free, ChickenWet Diet/One can a day: Nulo MedalSeries All Life Stages Wet Cat Food (flavor varies)Note: I used a detailed Reddit post about what to feed my kitten. I used the recommendation of the shelter on how often to feed my kitten.Product age: 1 weekCover type: uncoveredProduct Review:Overall, the product works great. Have not had to touch the product since in use. Based on the meter, as of this morning, she has used (or has been in) it 41 times since start (kittens tend to go more often than cats). Literally no smell of urine. However, the poop smell can be a lot. Do not stop reading here, we were transitioning our kitten’s diet from the shelter food, to what is listed above and now that she’s settled, the poop smell has gone away (inviting a honest friend over to give us the home smell test).The product advises not to use plugged in until your cat is 6 months old. Reading into it, it seems that all automatic/self-cleaning cat litter boxes have the same advisory because of the cats weight (may not register) or because they will try to play with it while it’s doing is cleaning cycle. Despite the advisory, I’m very much into instant gratification and plugged it in immediately. Fortunately, I work from home and have time to monitor kitty’s behavior. When the machine starts running, she does run to it to watch, but she’s never tried to play with it.Keep in mind, we have had our kitten for 2 weeks now. She used a regular litter box for a week while with us. When I made the switch to this product, I removed the old litter box completely from the household. I did not put any of her used litter in this product. However, I did sprinkle (literally a dash of) fresh litter that was used in her old litter box to mix with the crystals for this product. The original litter that we purchased advertised kitten attraction to get them familiar where to go. I placed this product where her original litter box was. I’m not sure how people know if their cats love their litter box, but I guess if they use it that means they love it? Anyway, she began using it immediately. We have had no accidents.Other review concerns commentary:Poop sticking to the rake: had one experience with it, it was not terrible, and after it cycled a couple times it had fallen off the rake. Also, it was during good transition.Leaking litter tray: have not checked, a little scared to check. However, I would be surprised if it got through the tray and the lid to get to the floor. The disposable tray fits into the lid. Once it’s time dispose, you remove the lid from the tray and place it on top.Odor control: Literally no pee smell. Poop smell during food transition. Honest friend home smell test to come. My friend does not have a cat.Expensive: Yes. Expected, yes. It is not unusual when one buys things like this, they are going to have to fork out some money to maintain it. Someone buys a luxury car, they pay extra for maintenance. Faulting the product over how much it costs and how much the tray replacements is not fair in my opinion.Edit: Passed friend test.Still works great.Tray did not leak. I’ve replaced the tray at about 75 uses.Edit: 10/21/2022Still love this product. I’ve opted to buy the drop in top to keep the dogs away. Now that my cat is a little older, it is about a month of use before replacing.If people are having issues it is probably because they are not using it as intended or they feed their cats a poor diet.",5,NA
"Cat Supplies","PetSafe ScoopFree Crystal Pro Self Cleaning Litter Box","Tehani","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2021","I've always had cats.  I've spent my life scooping stinky litter boxes, trying different kinds of litter; clumping, non-clumping, open-top boxes, closed-top boxes, and using a Litter Genie.  Even after scooping the box ,the smell of litter still permeates the room.  For the past 6 years I've only had 1 cat and just cleaning the box with 1 cat was stinky and complicated.  I recently rescued a cat and couldn't imagine cleaning a 2-cat litter box.  So began my online search for an alternative to the traditional litter box.  I found this PetSafe automatic box and spent days researching it online.  As usual, there are good reviews and bad reviews.  I wasn't even completely sure how it worked, but I bought it because it could only be better than what I had.  I have to say I love it and have no regrets!  The ""box"" is the disposable cardboard box that holds the crystals (very different and much better than traditional litter).  What you're purchasing is actually a plastic lid that sits on top of the disposable cardbox box, but it's so much more than just a lid!  I love the raking mechanism and the way it pushes the waste into the reservoir underneath the plastic hood.  Traditional litter, both clumping and non-clumping will not work with this because it gums up the rake.  The crystals actually dessicate the waste and draw out the moisture, making it a hard clump.  If my cat leaves a large amount of waste, the rake will occasionally get hung up during the cleaning cycle.  Fixing this is easy, I just put on a rubber glove and pull the hardened waste out of the rake and reset the raking cycle, then it pushes it easily into the reservoir.  I can get about 30 uses out of each disposable box and I base this on when I can start smelling urine coming from the reservoir (this is with 2 cats using it).  Now about the disposable boxes; yes, they are a little expensive, but I'll pay basically any price to not have to deal with regular litter.  After reading reviews about urine leaking from the bottom of the cardboard box, I bought a plastic mat and put it on the floor underneath the reservoir area, it's never been wet and I've never had a problem with urine soaking through the box.  When it's time to change out the box, I just put the top back on (following the instructions) and then use packing tape to seal all 4 sides of the box and then slip it into a large garbage bag.  One of the things I really like about this method, is that the plastic lid is easy to clean after you remove the used cardboard box.  I just take a disposable bleach wipe and wipe down the entire lid and the rakes and then vacuum the area to clean up any stray crystals.  This automatic box is much cleaner and more sanitary than traditional boxes and there truly is no odor.  It's refreshing to go into the room where the litter box is and not smell litter.  I'm actually getting ready to purchase a second automatic box because I found out my rescue cat is pregnant!  I wouldn't recommend the automatic box for tiny kittens, but I plan to unplug the boxes, let the cats and kittens use them, and then plug in and rake while I supervise so that no one gets trapped in the rakes or under the hood.",5,NA
